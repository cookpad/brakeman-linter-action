## Brakeman results parser github action

Brakeman is a static analysis tool which checks Ruby on Rails applications for security vulnerabilities.

You can read more about Brakeman itself [here](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman).

This action helps make sure that brakeman results get accurately added to pull requests, in the event of a new issue.

Currently we hardcode the brakeman version (5.2.1) to prevent the unintended consequences of pulling down the latest version
regardless of context.
